# Date Created: 2021-02-10

# Purpose:
# We will learn how to work with the weights in the GSS survey to analyze questions using data visualizations. 

# Set Up####
# Libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Data
# Load data 
load('DALs/DAL4/data/gss_df.Rdata')

# Let's Look Only at the 2018 Data 
gss_2018_df <- gss_df %>% 
  filter(YEAR == 2018)

# Question 1 ####
# Let's look at the relationship between sex and approval of federal support for science. We are testing a theory that says sex causes people to form their opinion about whether the federal government should support science. 

# We have translated this theory into a set of hypotheses that we are testing. 

H0 <- "The percent of men and women who approve of federal support for science the same." 

Ha <- "The percent of men and women who approve of federal support for science is not the same." 

# First let's check the unique value of Advfront_df
unique(gss_2018_df$ADVFRONT)

# We need to filter out observations where the value of ADVFRONT is "Not applicable". We also need to summize the data by SEX and ADVFRONT. 
sex_Advfront_df <- gss_2018_df %>%
  filter(ADVFRONT != "Not applicable") %>% 
  group_by(SEX, ADVFRONT) %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(WTSSALL))

# Calculate percent of men who feel a certain way
male_Advfront_df <- sex_Advfront_df %>% 
  filter(SEX == "Male")

# Total Number of men 
male_Advfront_df %>% 
  group_by(SEX) %>% 
  count()

# Calculate men's responses as percentages. 
male_Advfront_df <- male_Advfront_df %>% 
  mutate(Advfront_perc = n/491 * 100) %>% 
  select(SEX, ADVFRONT,  Advfront_perc)

# Calculate percent of women who feel a certain way
female_Advfront_df <- sex_Advfront_df %>% 
  filter(SEX == "Female")

# Total Number of women 
female_Advfront_df %>% 
  group_by(SEX) %>% 
  count()

# Calculate women's responses as percentages. 
female_Advfront_df <- female_Advfront_df %>% 
  mutate(Advfront_perc = n/670 * 100) %>% 
  select(SEX, ADVFRONT,  Advfront_perc)

# Create unified data frame of men and women by using bind_rows. 
sex_Advfront_per_df <- bind_rows(female_Advfront_df, male_Advfront_df)

# Text vector for Reordering ADVFRONT when we code it as a vector
levels <- c("Strongly agree", "Agree", "Disagree", "Strongly disagree", "Dont know", "No answer")

# ggplot bar graph of sex_Advfront_per_df
sex_Advfront_per_df %>% 
  mutate(ADVFRONT = factor(ADVFRONT, levels=levels)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= SEX, y=Advfront_perc, fill=ADVFRONT)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity")


# Question 1: Which hypothesis does the visualization provide evidence against? Why?

Answer1 <- "The visualization provides evidence against the research hypothesis. The support is nearly identical, with only a few percentage points of difference between male and female respondents." 
Answer1

# Question 2 #### 
# Now we are going to test a second theory related to Sex. We are testing the theory that Sex causes differences in how people view space exploration. 

# Hypotheses
H0 <- "The percent of men and women who approve of federal support for science the same." 

Ha <- "The percent of men and women who approve of federal support for science is not the same." 

# We will use repeat the process from question 1. 
sex_Natspac_df  <- gss_2018_df %>%
  filter(NATSPAC != "Not applicable") %>% 
  group_by(SEX, NATSPAC) %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(WTSSALL))

# Calculate percent of men who feel a certain way
male_Natspac_df <- sex_Natspac_df %>% 
  filter(SEX == "Male")

# Total Number of men 
male_Natspac_df %>% 
  group_by(SEX) %>% 
  count()

# Calculate men's responses as percentages. 
male_Natspac_df <- male_Natspac_df %>% 
  mutate(Natspac_perc = n/491 * 100) %>% 
  select(SEX, NATSPAC,  Natspac_perc)

# Calculate percent of women who feel a certain way
female_Natspac_df <- sex_Natspac_df %>% 
  filter(SEX == "Female")

# Total Number of women 
female_Natspac_df %>%

  count()

# Calculate women's responses as percentages. 
female_Natspac_df <- female_Natspac_df %>% 
  mutate(Natspac_perc = n/670 * 100) %>% 
  select(SEX, NATSPAC,  Natspac_perc)

# Combine into single df using bind_rows()
sex_Natspac_perc_df <- bind_rows(female_Natspac_df, male_Natspac_df)

# Create text vector for reordering 
levels <- c("Too much", "About right", "Too little", "Don't know", "No answer")

# Create ggplot 
sex_Natspac_perc_df %>% 
  mutate(NATSPAC = factor(NATSPAC, levels = levels)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= SEX, y=Natspac_perc, fill=NATSPAC)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(breaks = levels, values = c("#FFCC00", "#33FF00", "#0033FF", "#999999", "#FFFFFF"))
  

# Question 2: Which hypothesis does this visualization provide evidence against? 
Answer2 <- "The visualization provides evidence against the null hypothesis. There is a noticeable difference between the support of space exploration by female and male respondents, with more males choosing not to answer."
